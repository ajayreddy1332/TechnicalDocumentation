Puzzle

Given an array of integers, like (17, 14, 27, 5, 19, 11)
find all reverse pairs, with the first number greater than the second
number, where the first number is ahead of the second number in the
original array. in this case, it will output (17,14), (17,5), (17, 11),
(14, 5), (14, 11), (27, 5), (27, 19), (27, 11), (19, 11)

tuple1 = (17,14,27,5,19,11)
for f in tuple1:
  n = f
  for n in tuple1:
    if f > n:
      print(f,n)
